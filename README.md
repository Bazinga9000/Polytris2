# Polytris2
Tetris with arbitrary polyominoes.

I wrote this back in 2019, and it's the fourth(?) version of this that I wrote. This code is extremely bad and I will probably do a full rewrite (probalby in a different language) rather than touching this again.

# Compiling
All you need to compile this is SFML. If you are on some Linux, you can probably grab this from your favorite package manager. (The relevant ubuntu command is `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`.) If you're on Windows, good luck and godspeed.

I compiled this using the terminal command:
`g++ *.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio`
